# Tracking URL

A list of javascript links (or webpages with javascript) that perform [browser fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_tracking). The original data set is collected by DuckDuckGo through its [Tracker Radar](https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-radar) project.

Data is updated on the first day of the month.

The list contains **all** the links that Tracker Radar detected to have browser fingerprinting, there is no further processing to remove false positive. This is not a blocklist (yet).
