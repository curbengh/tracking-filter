# Tracking URL

This is not a block list. This is a list ([tracking-data.txt](dist/tracking-data.txt)) of javascript links (or webpages with javascript) that perform [browser fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_tracking). The original data set is collected by DuckDuckGo through its [Tracker Radar](https://github.com/duckduckgo/tracker-radar) project.

Data is updated on the first day of the month.

The list contains **all** the links that Tracker Radar detected to have browser fingerprinting, no further processing is performed to remove false positive, if any.
